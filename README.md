## RPA Projects

### Weather Bot (UiPath)
Prompts for a city/country → searches Google Weather → extracts **Temperature**, **Humidity**, **Status** → writes a note in **Notepad** and saves it as  
`City - YYYY-MM-DD HH-mm.txt`.

- **Folder:** [`RPA Projects/Weather Bot`](RPA%20Projects/Weather%20Bot/)
- **Run:** open `project.json` in UiPath Studio → restore packages → run **Modern** or **Classic** implementation.

---

### Select Assistant (Modular Workflow, UiPath)
A **menu‑driven, modular RPA bot** that lets you choose between two assistants at runtime:
**Movies** or **Temperature**. It demonstrates clean separation into reusable workflows and a
shared save routine.

**What it does**
- Presents a selector (Movies / Temperature) and routes to the chosen assistant.
- **Movies Assistant** → prompts for a title → fetches details from IMDb (Title, Year, Runtime, Rating, Popularity, URL) → writes a formatted note.
- **Temperature Assistant** → asks for City/Country → scrapes Google Weather (Temperature, Humidity, Status) → writes a formatted note.
- Uses a shared module **`SaveResultToNotepad.xaml`** to persist results with timestamped filenames in `/Output`.

**Folder:** [`RPA Projects/Modular_Workflow-SelectAssistant`](RPA%20Projects/Modular_Workflow-SelectAssistant/)
**Run:** open `project.json` in UiPath Studio → *Restore Dependencies* → run **Main Flow.xaml** (or **Main.xaml**) entry point.
